# This combination of chrom and segment will give us 
# Running on 138 variants with MAC >= 5
region:
  chromosome: 22
  segment: 297
# as a cross check the combination 22, 53 will not work, because line 53 is for
# chromosome 3, even though the segment marked in line 53 is good also for chrom
# 22. As a double verification, we can see that passing 3, 53 will work.
